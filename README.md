## Hi there 👋
🎓 Data Science and Machine Learning Portfolio

Welcome to my collection of applied Data Science and Machine Learning projects built using Python, scikit-learn, PyTorch, and transformer-based models. Each project demonstrates end-to-end workflows — from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model development, tuning, and interpretation.

DATA SCIENCE AND MACHINE LEARNING 
1. Supervised learning with scikit learn
   - [Classification](https://github.com/Joe-Naz01/telecom-churn-knn)
